To characterize a person's audio aura, we take a look at the average energy, valence, and danceability of the top 100 songs
that person listens to, and from my calculation using a few SQL queries, this is what I have gathered these information:
average energy       : 0.65906
average valence      : 0.484443
average danceability : 0.71646

Since we have 3 separate values, it might be a good idea to combine it into just 1 number by averaging the values for simplicity.
(0.65906 + 0.484443 + 0.71646) / 3 = 0.61998766666

This number signifies that the audio aura of that person is just slightly above half of the spectrum (value range is from 0 to 1.)
As you can see, this number doesn't really give us any insight about the person's listening behavior or their 2 most prominent moods.

To enhance this algorithm, we should write the program to count all the moods of the songs that the person listens to and then pick
just the top 2 moods to represent the person's audio aura instead.

But as we don't have the mood labelled directly for each song, using values like
danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, valence, tempo to calculate a separate value that is associated with the mood of music
might be the way to go if we want to gain some understanding about the person's listening pattern(s) and moods.
